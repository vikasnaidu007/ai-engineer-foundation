Q1. Why use if __name__ == "__main__"?
It makes sure the code runs only when the file is executed directly, not when it is imported into another file.

Q2. Why return an empty list on exception?
It prevents the program from crashing and allows the rest of the code to continue safely.

Q3. Why use a virtual environment?
It keeps project libraries separate, so different projects do not affect each other.
