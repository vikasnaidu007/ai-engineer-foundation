LinkedIn “About” Section (Best Version for You)
I am an AI Engineer / Agentic AI Developer with a strong foundation in Python and hands-on experience building LLM-powered applications, RAG systems, and multi-agent workflows.
I have practical experience in:
Python programming (functions, OOPS, data structures, recursion)
Prompt engineering (role prompting, structured outputs, self-consistency)
LangChain (chains, agents, output parsers, memory)
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using PDFs, CSVs, web data, embeddings, and vector stores
Text splitters, document loaders, embeddings & vector databases
LangGraph for state-based and conditional agent workflows
Multi-agent systems using CrewAI with human-in-the-loop, memory, and tool integration
LlamaIndex for data-centric RAG and agent implementations
Automation with n8n, including Telegram bots, calendar agents, and API-based workflows
REST API development using Flask to expose AI services
I enjoy designing real-world AI systems that go beyond chatbots and focus on:
Decision-making agents
Multi-agent collaboration
Enterprise-safe workflows with human approvals
AI + automation integrations
Currently, I am focused on building production-ready AI agents, strengthening my portfolio, and preparing for AI Engineer / Agentic AI Engineer roles.
